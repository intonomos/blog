Linear Quadratic Regular (LQR) is a special case of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) where,
- there is no noise in the system.
- the full state is observed.

LQR Formulation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underset{u(\cdot)}{\text{minimize }}
& \int_0^T \left( x^\top Q x + u^\top R u\right)\mathrm{d}t + x(T)^\top Q_f x(T)\\
\text{subject to }
& \dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\
& y = x\\
& x(0) = x_0
\end{aligned}
$$

LQG Formulation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underset{u(\cdot)}{\text{minimize }}
& \mathop{\mathbb{E}}\left[\int_0^T \left( x^\top Q x + u^\top R u\right)\mathrm{d}t + x(T)^\top Q_f x(T)\right]\\
\text{subject to }
& \dot{x} = Ax + Bu + w\\
& y = Cx + v\\
& x(0) = x_0
\end{aligned}
$$

where $$w$$, $$v$$ are Gaussian noises.
