One fundamental challenge in optimization-based trajectory planning is the appropriate formulation of collision avoidance constraints, which are known to be non-convex and computationally difficult to handle in general.

This paper provides a formulation for collision avoidance based on the notion of signed distance, which characterizes not only the distance between two objects but also their penetration.
