Before autonomous vehicles can be deployed in mass production, their control systems need to be tested and validated in terms of guaranteeing safety and performance when operating in various traffic environments, which remains a challenging problem.

On the one hand, simulation tools can be used for quick and safe virtual tests of these systems and to reduce the time and cost of road tests.

On the other hand, the reliability of virtual tests depends on the fidelity of the simulations in terms of modeling traffic scenarios.

Among different traffic scenarios, the interactive behavior of vehicles at intersections may be particularly complex. By types of traffic control, intersections can be classified as signal-controlled, “stop” or “yield” sign-controlled, and uncontrolled.

Drivers/automations need to decide whether, when, and how to enter and pass through the intersection on their own; in this case, accounting for the interactions among vehicles is particularly important.
